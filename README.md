# Adventure-Game-Builder-
In the early days of computing, before windows and graphic user interfaces, text based adventure games (such as the original Zork) were popular. Multi-user Internet variations of these games are still popular today.  In the text based adventure game, the player moves from room to room reading descriptions, finding objects which could be inspected or possibly carried, and interacting with hostile and benevolent creatures, all in a text based environment. The game would display a description of the room the person was in; and the user would attempt to interact with his environment via simple text commands. A sample transcript of such a game can be found here.  You assignment is to design a tool that will allow the user to create and connect rooms for a text based adventure game. You do not have to design an actual game! Many of the features in the above example will not be implemented in your program.
